NAME
----
git-history - EXPERIMENTAL: Rewrite history of the current branch

SYNOPSIS
--------
[synopsis]
git history reword <commit>

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Rewrite history by rearranging or modifying specific commits in the
history.

THIS COMMAND IS EXPERIMENTAL. THE BEHAVIOR MAY CHANGE.

This command is related to linkgit:git-rebase[1] in that both commands can be
used to rewrite history. You should use rebases if you want to reapply a range
of commits onto a different base, or interactive rebases if you want to edit a
range of commits.

Note that this command does not (yet) work with histories that contain
merges. You should use linkgit:git-rebase[1] with the `--rebase-merges`
flag instead.

COMMANDS
--------

Several commands are available to rewrite history in different ways:

`reword <commit>`::
	Rewrite the commit message of the specified commit. All the other
	details of this commit remain unchanged. This command will spawn an
	editor with the current message of that commit.
