hook.<name>.command::
	The command to execute for `hook.<name>`. `<name>` is a unique
	"friendly" name that identifies this hook. (The hook events that
	trigger the command are configured with `hook.<name>.event`.) The
	value can be an executable path or a shell oneliner. If more than
	one value is specified for the same `<name>`, only the last value
	parsed is used. See linkgit:git-hook[1].

hook.<name>.event::
	The hook events that trigger `hook.<name>`. The value is the name
	of a hook event, like "pre-commit" or "update". (See
	linkgit:githooks[5] for a complete list of hook events.) On the
	specified event, the associated `hook.<name>.command` is executed.
	This is a multi-valued key. To run `hook.<name>` on multiple
	events, specify the key more than once. An empty value resets
	the list of events, clearing any previously defined events for
	`hook.<name>`. See linkgit:git-hook[1].

hook.<name>.enabled::
	Whether the hook `hook.<name>` is enabled. Defaults to `true`.
	Set to `false` to disable the hook without removing its
	configuration. This is particularly useful when a hook is defined
	in a system or global config file and needs to be disabled for a
	specific repository. See linkgit:git-hook[1].

hook.jobs::
	Specifies how many hooks can be run simultaneously during parallelized
	hook execution. If unspecified, defaults to the number of processors on
	the current system.
+
This has no effect for hooks requiring separate output streams (like `pre-push`)
unless `extensions.hookStdoutToStderr` is enabled.

hook.forceStdoutToStderr::
	A boolean that enables the `extensions.hookStdoutToStderr` behavior
	(merging stdout to stderr for all hooks) globally. This effectively
	forces all hooks to behave as if the extension was enabled, allowing
	parallel execution for hooks like `pre-push`.
